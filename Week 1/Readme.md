# Introduction

Basic definition and understanding of what is Machine Learning and what are the different types of Machine Learning Algorithms



## Machine Learning

  * Natural Language Processing
  * Computer Vision
* Self customizing programs
  * Amazon
  * Netflix
  * Product Recommendations
* Understanding Human Learning
  * The Human Brain
  * Real Artificial Intelligence

### What is Machine Learning?

* Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* A learning problem is said to learn from experience 'E' with respect to some task 'T' and some performance measure 'P', if its performance on 'T' as measured by 'P' improves with experience 'E'.

> Suppose your email program watches emails you do or do not mark as 'spam', and based on that learns how to better filter spam. What's the task 'T' in this setting?
>
> - [x] **Classifying emails as 'spam' or 'not-spam'**
> - [ ] Watching you label emails as 'spam' or 'not-spam'
> - [ ] Fraction of emails correctly classified as 'spam' or 'not-spam'



## Supervised Learning

* Assumes that right answers are given to the algorithm in the training set for all cases
* Also called "Regression Problems", predicts continuous valued output
* Can also be a Classification Problem, which can predict discrete values (0 or 1)
